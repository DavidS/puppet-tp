# Using Tiny Puppet


## Essential usage patterns

Install an application with default settings (package installed, service started)

    tp::install { 'redis': }

Install an application specifying a custom dependency class (where, for example, you can add a custom package repository. Note however that for some applications and Operating System TP provides and manages automatically the upstream repository)

    tp::install { 'lighttpd':
      dependency_class => 'site::lighttpd::repo',
    }

Configure the application main configuration file a custom erb template which uses data from a custom $options_hash:

    tp::conf { 'rsyslog':
      template     => 'site/rsyslog/rsyslog.conf.erb',
      options_hash => hiera('rsyslog::options_hash'),
    }

Populate any custom directory from a Git repository (it requires Puppet Labs' vcsrepo module):

    tp::dir { '/opt/apps/my_app':
      source      => 'https://git.example.42/apps/my_app/',
      vcsrepo     => 'git',
    }


## Installation alternatives

Install custom packages (with the ```settings_hash``` argument you can override any application specific setting)

    tp::install { 'redis':
      settings_hash => {
        'package_name'     => 'my_redis',
        'config_file_path' => '/opt/etc/redis',
      },
    }

Use the ```tp::stdmod``` define to manage an application using stdmod compliant parameters.

Note that ```tp::stdmod``` is alternative to ```tp::install``` (both of them manage packages and services) and may be complementary to ```tp::conf``` (you can configure files with both).

    tp::stdmod { 'redis':
      config_file_template => 'site/redis/redis.conf',
    }

To uninstall an application:

    tp::uninstall { 'redis': }


## Managing configurations

By default, configuration files managed by tp::conf automatically notify the service(s) and require the package(s) installed via tp::install. If you use tp::conf without a relevant tp::install define and have dependency cycle problems or references to non existing resources, you can disable these automatic relationships:

    tp::conf { 'bind':
      config_file_notify  => false,
      config_file_require => false,
    }

You can also set custom resource references to point to actual resources you declare in your manifests:

    tp::conf { 'bind':
      config_file_notify  => Service['bind9'],
      config_file_require => Package['bind9-server'],
    }

It's possible to manage files with different methods, for example directly providing its content:

    tp::conf { 'redis':
      content => 'my content is king',
    }

or providing a custom erb template (used as ```content => template($template)```):

    tp::conf { 'openssh::ssh_config':
      template    => 'site/openssh/ssh_config.erb',
    }

or using a custom epp template with Puppet code instead of Ruby (used as ```content => epp($epp)```):

    tp::conf { 'redis:
      epp   => 'site/redis/redis.conf.epp',
    }


also it's possible to provide the source to use, instead of managing it with the content argument:

    tp::conf { 'redis':
      source      => [ "puppet:///modules/site/redis/redis.conf-${hostname}" ,
                       'puppet:///modules/site/redis/redis.conf' ] ,
    }

Tp:conf has some conventions on the actual configuration file manages.

By default, if you just specify the application name, the file managed is the "main" configuration file of that application (in case this is not evident or may be questionable, check the data files for the actual value used).

    # This manages /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    tp::conf { 'openssh':
      [...]
    }

If you specify a file name after the application name in the title, separated by ```::```, that file is placed in the "base" configuration dir:

    # This manages /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    tp::conf { 'openssh::ssh_config':
      [...]
    }

If you explicitly set a path, that path is used and the title is ignored (be sure, anyway, to refer to a supported application and is not duplicated in your catalog):

    # This manages /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    tp::conf { 'openssh::ssh_config':
      [...]
    }

If you explicitly set a path, that path is used and the title is ignored (be sure, anyway, to refer to a supported application and is not duplicated in your catalog):

    # This manages /usr/local/bin/openssh_check
    tp::conf { 'openssh::ssh_check':
      path => '/usr/local/bin/openssh_check',
      [...]
    }

## Managing directories

Manage a whole configuration directory:

    tp::dir { 'redis':
      source      => 'puppet:///modules/site/redis/',
    }

Manage a specific directory type. Currently defined directories types are:
  - ```config``` : The application [main] configuration directory (Default value)
  - ```conf``` : A directory where you can place single configuration files (typically called ./conf.d )
  - ```data``` : Directory where application data resides
  - ```log``` : Dedicated directory for logs, if present

Note that some of these directory types might not be defined for every application.

    tp::dir { 'apache':
      base_dir => 'data',
      source   => 'puppet:///modules/site/apache/default_site',
    }

Clone a whole configuration directory from a Git repository (it requires Puppet Labs' vcsrepo module):

    tp::dir { 'redis':
      source      => 'https://git.example.42/puppet/redis/conf/',
      vcsrepo     => 'git',
    }

Populate any custom directory from a Subversion repository (it requires Puppet Labs' vcsrepo module):

    tp::dir { 'my_app': # The title is irrelevant, when path argument is used
      path        => '/opt/apps/my_app',
      source      => 'https://svn.example.42/apps/my_app/',
      vcsrepo     => 'svn',
    }

Provide a data directory (the default DocumentRoot, for apache) from a Git repository (it requires Puppet Labs' vcsrepo module) (TODO):

    tp::dir { 'apache':
      # base_dir is a tag that defines the type of directory for the specified application.
      # Default: config. Other possible dir types: 'data', 'log', 'confd', 'lib'
      # or any other name defined in the application data with a format like: ${base_dir}_dir_path
      base_dir    => 'data'
      source      => 'https://git.example.42/apps/my_app/',
      vcsrepo     => 'git',
    }


## Managing repositories

Currently Tiny Puppet supports applications' installation only via the OS native packaging system. In order to cope with software which may not be provided by default on an OS, TP provides the ```tp::repo``` define that manages YUM and APT repositories for RedHat and Debian based Linux distributions.

The data about a repository is managed as all the other data of Tiny Puppet. Find [here](https://github.com/example42/puppet-tp/blob/master/data/elasticsearch/osfamily/Debian.yaml) an example for managing Apt repositories and [here](https://github.com/example42/puppet-tp/blob/master/data/elasticsearch/osfamily/RedHat.yaml) one for Yum ones.

Generally you don't have to use directly the ```tp::repo``` defined, as, when the repository data is present, it's automatically added from the ```tp::install``` one.

If, for whatever reason, you don't want to automatically manage a repository for an application, you can set to ```false``` the ```auto_repo``` parameter, and, eventually you can manage the repository in a custom dependency class:

    tp::install { 'elasticsearch':
      auto_repo        => false,
      dependency_class => '::site::elasticseach::repo', # Possible alternative class to manage the repo
    }


## Usage with Hiera

You may find useful the ```create_resources``` defines that are feed, in the main ```tp``` class by special ```hiera_hash``` lookups that map all the available ```tp``` defines to hiera keys in this format ```tp::<define>_hash```.

Although such approach is very powerful (and totally optional) we recommend not to abuse of it.

Tiny Puppet is intended to be used in modules like profiles, your data should map to parameters of such classes, but if you want to manage directly via Hiera some tp resources you have to include the main class:

    include tp

In the class are defined Hiera lookups (using hiera_hash so thy are recursive (and this may hurt a log when abusing) that expects parameters like the ones in the following sample in Yaml.

As an handy add-on, a ```create_resources``` is run also on the variables ```tp::packages```, ```tp::services```, ```tp::files``` to eventually manage the relevant Puppet resource types.

Not necessarily recommended, but useful to understand the usage basic patterns.
