# Tiny Puppet

Tiny Puppet is single Puppet module that manages virtually any application.

It can replace or integrate existing component application modules.

It features:

- Quick, easy to use, standard, coherent, powerful interface to the managed resources

- Out of the box and easily expandable support for most common Operating Systems

- Modular data source design. Support for an easily growing set of applications.

- Smooth coexistence with any existing Puppet modules setup: you decide what to manage

Application data stored in a configurable separated module ([tinydata](https://github.com/example42/tinydata) is the default source for applications data)
